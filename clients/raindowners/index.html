                                <p>Though small in territory, Lake Manyara boasts an impressive range of habitats. Dense
                                    woodlands of the park will serve a nice change of scenery after the savanna
                                    dominated landscapes and will treat you to viewings of primates, ungulates and, if
                                    you are lucky, tree-climbing lions! Out in the open you will get to enjoy the view
                                    of Lake Manyara’s serene waters and various birds flocking to its shores.</p>

                                <p>The strongest appeal of Arusha lies in its unique varied geology. Tropical rainforest

                                    for the most exciting walking safari route! Only in Arusha will you get up so close
                                    and personal with the multiple colobus monkeys, giraffes, buffalo and antelopes that
                                    live here. To top off this fairytail experience, you’ll head for the Momella Lakes
                                    to watch the migrating water birds that are regular visitors here.</p>
